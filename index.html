                    <p>     Welcome to my Portfolio where I’ll be providing a brief overview of my past employment history and applicable skill sets.  In 2011 I founded Vis Pacem LLC.  Vis Pacem supplied journalists, advenurers and military contractors with hard to find surplus equipment.  I sourced specialized military equipment on the secondary market and established a network of customers who where unable to efficiently get their equipment needs met.  Vis Pacem supplied medical, climbing, protective and communication gear to fill the crucial needs of our customer base.  I was able to follow all legal guidelines while ensuring my customer base had the equipment they needed to operate safely and efficiently.
                      In 2016 I temporarily moved to Washington State where I established Blockchain Logistics Inc. one year later.  Blockchain Logistics Inc. successfully identified some of the cheapest electricity in the United States and successfully established two Cryptocurrency Mining Facilities.  All cooling, networking, and profit switching was automated and the facility was run by a employee who was trained from the ground up and had no prior experience in cryptocurrency or networking.  The larger facility was run successfully for 3 years after which it was sold.
                      I am trilingual with conversational French, Spanish, Farsi and of course English.  My educational background includes Mirman School for gifted children and some training in Emergency Medicine including Emergency Medical Technician and Phlebotomy training.  Currently I am enrolled in the UCLA Coding Bootcamp where I am gaining knowledge on the fundamentals of full-stack coding.
                      I’m now looking to join a solid team where I can contribute and be a force multiplier.  I’m eager to learn and can adapt seamlessly to any environment.
